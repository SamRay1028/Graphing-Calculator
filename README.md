# Graphing-Calculator

Description:
This software allows users to input polynomial equations and receive said equations graphical representation. The program prompts users to input a polynomial equation. The program then parses the string input into its component coefficients, exponents, and arithmetic operations. The program then feeds x coordinates through the "createPoints" method that produces a corresponding y coordinate output by applying the various coefficients, exponents and arithmetic operations that were parsed from the user input. The x and corresponding y coordinates are used as a basis for the start and termination of lines that are drawn on a graph that is utlimately presented to users. The entire program essentially acts like Desmos.
